                            <h4>Tell us a little about the place you grew up in!</h4>
                            <p>"I grew up in Bahrain, and it&apos;s always felt like home. It&apos;s a small island, but
                                there&apos;s so much life here. I&apos;ve watched the city grow, but there&apos;s still
                                something
                                about the sunsets by the water and the quiet moments in the souqs that make me feel
                                grounded.
                                Whether it&apos;s the familiar streets, the food, or just the people, there&apos;s a
                                warmth here that&apos;s hard to put into words. Bahrain will always be where I feel most
                                connected."
                            </p>

                            <h4>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?</h4>
                            <p>"In my free time, I love getting lost in music—it has a way of calming my mind. I also
                                enjoy exploring newly opened spots around the city, always excited to discover something
                                fresh. Hiking and spending time in nature are my escapes, where I can just breathe and
                                feel at peace with the world. These simple moments bring me so much joy."</p>

                            <h4>Describe your programming background.</h4>
                            <p>"I&apos;ve been working with Python for a while now, and it&apos;s become a language I&apos;m really
                                comfortable with. One of my proudest moments was winning a Python game-building
                                competition, which gave me a real boost. I also had the chance to build a volunteer
                                hours tracker web app for McDonald&apos;s Bahrain, which was a rewarding project. I&apos;m
                                constantly learning more, whether it&apos;s diving deeper into Python or exploring new tools
                                and frameworks. Each project I work on helps me improve and stay excited about what&apos;s
                                next in the world of programming."</p>

                            <h4>Tell us a little about the place you grew up in!</h4>
                            <p>"I grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, a wonderful place where I met all my lovely
                                friends. I&apos;m definitely a city girl, and Ho Chi Minh City is a place that never
                                sleeps.
                                My friends and I often hang out at night, the coffee shops or restaurants stay open
                                until 10 or 11 PM, and there&apos;s always amazing street food at super affordable
                                prices.
                                Living here feels full of energy, even late at night. Sometimes when I get bored, my
                                friends and I just ride our motorbikes around the city to enjoy the fresh, cool night
                                air. Just looking at the city lights and the energetic streets gives me a sense of home
                                and happiness. It&apos;s one of those simple things that makes living in Ho Chi Minh
                                City
                                feel so special to me."</p>

                            <h4>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?</h4>
                            <p>"One of my favorite hobbies is playing the violin, since it really helps me release
                                stress and express myself through music. I especially love playing Studio Ghibli songs,
                                like Merry-Go-Round of Life, as the melodies are so beautiful and calming. I enjoy
                                watching K-dramas because I find Korean culture interesting and the dramas
                                themselves are highly engaging, allowing me to feel a connection. Since I&apos;m an
                                extrovert person, of course I love going out with friends as it helps
                                me recharge my energy. I love to go out and eat, exploring new places in Melbourne
                                (since I&apos;m also new in this city), or maybe yapping about our life."</p>

                            <h4>Describe your programming background.</h4>
                            <p>"I have some experience with Java and HTML & CSS from high school. One of the projects I
                                worked on was a Java game called "Game of Chance," where players bet money to win. They
                                start with $1,000 and aim to reach $5,000 to win. Players can borrow once from a virtual
                                bank, repaying 10% of the debt each round. If they run out of money before repaying,
                                they lose."</p>

                                views and walking tracks around. The town has a few restaurants and a primary school.
                                Recently, the old primary school was turned into a park. I also don&apos;t live far from
                                an anti-gravity hill (No, I will not elaborate further)."</p>

                                projects. I learnt most things I know from working on these projects and continue to
                                learn and discover new things through them."</p>

                            <p>"I have been programming for a while. I started with scratch where I dabbled in very
                                basic 3D graphics and generational models. I also used another blocked based visual
                                scripting system to program an EV3 for some kids robotics competitions. Since then I
                                have been using C# and HLSL with Unity for game jams and personal projects, a variant of
                                C++ for Arduino, and a bit of Python, PHP, and Typescript/JavaScript."</p>
